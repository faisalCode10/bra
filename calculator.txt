Calculate Your Band Size:

Subtract your underbust measurement from your bust measurement.
Refer to the UK band size chart below:
Difference (inches)	UK Band Size
1 inch	    30
2 inches	32
3 inches	34
4 inches	36
5 inches	38
6 inches	40
7 inches or more	42

Compare the difference between your bust and underbust measurements to the UK cup size chart below:
Difference (inches)	UK Cup Size
1 inch	    AA
2 inches	A
3 inches	B
4 inches	C
5 inches	D
6 inches	DD
7 inches	E
8 inches	F
9 inches	G
10 inches or more H


the formula to calculate the bra size is:
// Bra Size = Band Measurement - Underbust Measurement + UK Band Size + UK

//Calculate the cup size =  
cupSize = Bust measurement - Band measuremen

Band Size = Underbust Measurement
Bra Size = Band Size + Cup Size




// calculate the bra size of France / Spain    
//france and Spain uses centimeter to measure their bra size 
// BandSize = measure around your ribcage just below your bust this measurements is in centimeter
// Example: 75 cm underbust measurement would correspond to a band size of 75.
//Underbust Measurement = 75
//Band Size= 75
//Bra Size = Band Size - Underbust Measurement + 30(UK Band 
//Cup Size = Bust Measurement - Band Size



Here's a simplified guide for cup sizes based on the difference:

1 cm: A
2 cm: B
3 cm: C
4 cm: D
5 cm: E (or DD in some systems)
6 cm: F (or DDD in some systems)

//For example, if your underbust measurement is 75 cm and your bust measurement is 90 cm, the difference is 15 cm. The band size is 75, and the cup size might be B. So, the bra size would be 75B.

For example, if you have a bust measurement of 80cm and an underbust
measurement of 70cm, your bra size would be calculated as follows:
Bra Size = 70 - 80 + 30 = -10 + Cup Size = 80 - 70 = 10



//how to measure bra size in eur
Calculating your bra size in the European system involves measuring two key aspects: the band size and the cup size. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you determine your bra size in the European system:

Measure Your Band Size:

Use a soft measuring tape and measure around your ribcage, just under your bust.
Make sure the tape is snug but not too tight. Round the measurement to the nearest whole number.
If the measurement is even, add 4 inches (10 cm) to it. If it's odd, add 5 inches (12.5 cm). This gives you your band size.
Measure Your Bust Size:

Measure around the fullest part of your bust, making sure the tape is parallel to the ground.
Again, ensure that the tape is snug but not too tight. Round the measurement to the nearest whole number.
Calculate Cup Size:

Subtract your band size from your bust measurement. The difference corresponds to the cup size according to the following scale:
0: AA
1: A
2: B
3: C
4: D
5: DD or E
6: DDD or F
7: G
8: H
9: I
Determine Your Bra Size:

Combine your band size and cup size to get your final bra size. For example, if your band size is 34 and your cup size is B, your bra size would be 34B.


// Usa /Mexico bra size 

Measuring bra size in the USA/Mexico typically involves two measurements: the band size and the cup size.

Here are the steps to measure your bra size:

1. Band Size: Take a tape measure and measure around your ribcage, just under your bust. Make sure the tape measure is snug, but not tight, and is parallel to the ground. Round the measurement to the nearest whole number. This measurement is your band size.

2. Cup Size: Measure around the fullest part of your bust. Make sure the tape measure is straight across your back and not too tight. Round the measurement to the nearest whole number.

3. Calculate Your Cup Size: Subtract your band size from your bust measurement. The difference between the two measurements determines your cup size. Use the following chart to determine your cup size:



Difference (in inches)  
 Cup Size (USA/MEX)
0  AA
1  A
2  B
3  C
4  D
5  DD(E)
6 DDD(F)
7 DDDD(G)




// Bra sizes in AUS/NZ



Measuring bra sizes in Australia and New Zealand is similar to measuring bra sizes in other countries. You will need a measuring tape and a mirror to accurately measure your size. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Measure your band size: Wear a non-padded bra and measure your ribcage directly under your bust, making sure the tape measure is parallel to the ground. Round up to the nearest whole number. This number is your band size. 

2. Measure your cup size: Measure the fullest part of your bust, making sure the tape measure is parallel to the ground. Round up to the nearest whole number. Subtract your band size from this number to determine your cup size. Use the chart below to determine your cup size based on the difference in inches between your band size and your bust measurement:
